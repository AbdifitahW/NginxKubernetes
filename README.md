# NginxKubernetes

The purpose of this project was to spin up a simple web deployment and incorporate services, secrets, services accounts, horizontal pod autoscaling, and pod distrubition budgets within a Kubernetes cluster.

## Installation

The environment that I ran this on was a Windows OS running WSL2 (Ubuntu).
Follow this [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) guide to set that up.
